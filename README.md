# Dragonball Web Project

Welcome to the **Dragonball Web Project**, a dynamic web application that showcases information about Dragonball characters and planets. This project was created as part of an assignment using **JavaScript, APIs, HTML, and CSS** to consume and display data from the [Dragonball API](https://web.dragonball-api.com/).
